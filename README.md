# ⚪ Circle Array Example – Java Lab 💻

This Java program demonstrates **creating an array of objects** using the `circle` class. It initializes an array of **17 circle objects** and prints their indices.  

---

## 🚀 Features

- Creates an **array of circle objects**  
- Iterates through the array and prints **circle number**  
- Good practice for **object arrays and loops** in Java 🔄  

---

## 🎮 How to Run

1. Compile the Java file:
```bash
javac circle.java
````

2. Run the program:

```bash
java circle
```

3. Output will show:

```
Cirlce number :0
Cirlce number :1
...
Cirlce number :16
```

## 💡 Notes

* This program **does not calculate area or circumference**; it only demonstrates object creation in arrays.
* Perfect for **understanding object arrays** and **loop iteration** in Java.
